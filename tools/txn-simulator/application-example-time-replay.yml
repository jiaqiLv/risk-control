# Example Configuration: Time-Based Replay
# Use this to replay transactions with realistic timing

simulator:
  mode: REPLAY_DT

  time-replay:
    speed-multiplier: 60.0  # 60x speed (1 hour becomes 1 minute)

  rate-control:
    concurrency: 50  # Higher concurrency for replay mode

  execution:
    max-records: -1  # Process all records

  output:
